When writting a for loop, we need the following three parts: 
  a variable initialization where we declare the variable we will use in the condition; 
  a condition expression which is boolean (can only return true or false); and
  steps defining the incremental or decremental part.
Example: for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}

When writting a while loop, we only need a condition expression.
Example: while (i < 10) {}
